# VL.Devices.Axis

Support for [network cameras](https://www.axis.com/products/network-cameras) by [Axis](https://www.axis.com/).

[VAPIXÂ®](https://developer.axis.com/vapix/), the API's for cameras by Axis are vast. This NuGet only wraps a fraction of those for convenient use. If you need support for a specific API, it can most likely be added without too much effort. 

Currently only supports choosing a streams resolution, fps and toggle the IRCut filter.

For use with vvvv, the visual live-programming environment for .NET: http://vvvv.org
